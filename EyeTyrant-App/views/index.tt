    D&D DM Framework for Electronic table display
</p>
<p>
    This project is to help facilitate the DM process
    while using an electronic table (A table with a TV in it).
</p>
<p>
    The goal is to have an Initiative sorter for Players and NPCs,
    Searchable Bestiary, and a Searchable Spell list. The players
    will have the ability to provide a character portait. This portrate
    will be displayed when it is their initiative.
