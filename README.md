D&amp;D DM Framework for Electronic table display

This project is to help facilitate the DM process
while using an electronic table (A table with a TV in it).

The goal is to have an Initiative sorter for Players and NPCs,
Searchable Bestiary, and a Searchable Spell list.
The players will have the ability to provide a character portrate.
This portrate will be displayed when it is their initiative.
